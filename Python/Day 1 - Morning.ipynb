    "# Day 1: Morning Session\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Python section of the Advanced Topics in Scientific Programming (ATSP) 2025 course! \n",
    "\n",
    "We start his course with Python, and we will have two and a half days of Python in Machine Learning material, where we will discuss the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Day 1 will focus on basics of **Python**, **Numpy**, **Jupyter**, and then machine learning methods using **Sci-Kit Learn**\n",
    "    - As I understand it, you you have already done Pandas in the introduction course?\n",
    "    - If we need a refresher on Pandas, we can do so quickly in this morning session now. \n",
    "- Day 2 will focus on **Deep Learning** \n",
    "- Day 3 will focus on **model deployment** and your assignment **assignment** for the course\n",
    " \n",
    "Your assignment will be to complete an end-to-end machine learning project - you will have the choice of several assignments. We will go in to more details regarding the assignment on Wednesday. One of the assignments will be an image classification assignment using deep neural networks, a second option for your assignment focusses developing a web application, and another option for your assignment relates to a text or tabular dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Admin and Materials\n",
    "Let's first discuss some administrative matters and the material for the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide the materials as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "- All course materials are provided and presented as Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "- Jupyter is a web-based development enviroment for Python, R, etc.\n",
    "- During the seminars, we will use this server to run and execute the code live\n",
    "- Each of you has an account so you can log in to the server and access the materials and follow along while we code, you can also experiment with the code, etc.\n",
    "- The server will only run during the seminar times. Outside of the seminars, you will be able to access the notebooks via our GitHub repository\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that to run the notebooks outside of the seminar times, you will need to install and run Jupyter locally, or use something like Google Colab, which we discuss in detail tomorrow. Tomorrow afternoon, we will discuss your assignment, and in this session we can set up Jupyter on your local machines, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Day 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will discuss the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is Jupyter and how to use it\n",
    "- Basics of Python\n",
    "- Basics of NumPy\n",
    "- Basics of Pandas (if required)\n",
    "- Machine Learning basics\n",
    "    - Classification, regression / Supervised vs. Unsupervised\n",
    "    - Overfitting and underfitting\n",
    "    - Model evaluation\n",
    "- SciKit Learn\n",
    "    - How to get data\n",
    "    - How to generate data\n",
    "    - Training, testing\n",
    "    - Cross validation\n",
    "    - Model persistence\n",
    "    - Scaling and normalisation\n",
    "    - Data preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "We will split this content into the morning and afternoon sessions. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, in a bit more detail, first we discuss Jupyter, and how to use it. We will use Jupyter almost entirely for this course, to cover the material, and to run code examples and so on. You can follow along and try code examples. Jupyter is a good skill to have if you work in data science, machine learning, or academic research in general. For example, it is very useful for reproducibility and for organising code, presenting work, and for development work when you are working on a project. You can use it as an IDE, and completely replace the use of a text editor. It is web-based, meaning all you need is a browser to use it. And it can be used remotely, for example you can code at home while accessing a server at work or anywhere else in the world. It is worth noting that Jupyter is not only for Python development, there are so-called kernels for dozens of languages, including R, Julia, MATLAB, Mathematica, SPSS, you name it! \n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub (which we will cover) also renders Jupyter notebooks natively, so it can be quite useful as a way to present your work for a paper, for example. We will look in to this in detail later. For example, these course materials are hosted on GitHub, and you can view these notebooks (statically) on GitHub without needing to install anything. More on this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "After covering Jupyter and how to use it, we cover the basics of Python. Python is a general purpose language, which makes it a very useful language to know - and of course it often used in the context of general Machine Learning tasks, but it completely dominates as the language of choice for Deep Learning. If you are doing any kind of Deep Neural Network training, you will most likely be using Python and frameworks such as Torch and TensorFlow. So in this section we will cover the basics of Python, such as functions, lists, classes, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have covered the basics of Python, then we will cover some tips and tricks for using Python in the context of Machine Learning, and cover some aspects of the language that make it useful for Data Science work in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we cover Numpy, which is a framework for handling data in Python. It provides essential functionality for manipulating array and matrix data and is used in practically any machine learing project. If required, we can cover Pandas as well, although I understand that this has already been covered in the introductory course.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we have covered the basics of Python programming, Jupyter, and Numpy, we will move on to Machine Learning methods using Python. The focus of this course is practical Machine Learning. We will not discuss in detail how the algorithms we cover work, it is focussed on how to train algorithms, what are best practices, where to get data, etc. and we will be mostly using SciKit-Learn for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note**: these notebooks are rather text-heavy: this is by design. The reason being, is that it should be possible for you to download and read and go through all these noteooks completely independently after the course has finished. Hence they should be self explanatory and be useful as a reference later, if you wish to go back to a topic (for your assignment, for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Day 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Day 2 will focus on Neural Networks and Deep Learning, as well as model deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple neural networks: we will use PyTorch to define a simple neural network and train it\n",
    "- PyTorch: we will discuss the framework we will use to create neural networks\n",
    "- Deep learning: we move to deep networks, the basis for all of the recent advancements, such as generative models and GPT models\n",
    "- Image classification: we will train an image classifier on a number of small tasks\n",
    "- Image segmentation: we discuss image segmentation in the context of medicine\n",
    "- Pre-trained models: use networks that have already been trained\n",
    "- Fine-tuning models: adapt a pre-trained network to your specific task \n",
    "- Model deployment and web application development / developing interfaces to your models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Day 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Day 3 is the morning session only, and we will mostly focus on your assignment. We will have time for you to start your assignments, and answer any questions you might have about the assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the course, we will complete some exercises. This will give you a chance to try what you have learned. So, periodically you will work on some programming exercises, which should typically take 20 minutes or so, and afterwards we will go over the exercises. They will **not** be used for your grading! The grading for the course will be based on your assignment only! \n",
    "\n",
    "## Get Started\n",
    "\n",
    "So, as mentioned, this course we are going to be using Jupyter almost exclusively. We have set up a server so that you can follow along with the examples that we cover here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The server can be accessed from:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <http://learnlab.medunigraz.at>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Do not worry if there is some warning about insecure HTTP: access to this server is limited to the MUG network and KAGes. No one else can access this server from outside of the MUG or the KAGes network.\n",
    "\n",
    "To log in, use atsp + matriculation number, e.g. `at07316801` and the password that will be shown on the whiteboard. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you log in, you will see the notebooks for the course. If you do not see any notebooks, then something went wrong! Most likely you have entered an incorrect matriculation number. Let's make sure everyone is logged in before we continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The server is only accessible from within the MUG network and KAGes network. If you are working from home, it should be possible to log in via the MUG VPN, but I have not tested this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The material (for example these notebooks, plus other material from the R part of the course, and datasets and so on) are all available under the following link on GitHub:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <https://github.com/imigraz/ATSP-2025>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a look at the repository now. You can download the contents of the repository as a zip file, or you can clone the repository using Git."

    "# Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "This environment that we are using now is called Jupyter. It provides an interactive web-based environment called notebooks. \n",

    "It is worth noting that Jupyter is not just for Python development. There are so-called kernels from dozens of languags, see <https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels>, including R. Also, Jupyter is used widely in acaedmia to disseminate results and experiments. It is therefore a very useful tool to aid reproducibility. A particularly good example of this can be found here: <https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3051> - you will find that there are a number of Jupyter notebooks associated with the paper, and they can be used to reproduce the exact same plots found with in the paper itself: <https://github.com/theandygross/TCGA/>. If you supply your experiments as a Jupyter notebook, anyone can download the notebooks, and run them on their local machine, confirming your results. This can greatly enhance your chances of getting a paper published! \n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub natively supports Jupyter, so you can host notebooks for free there. Example: <https://github.com/mdbloice/Augmentor/blob/master/notebooks/Augmentor_Keras.ipynb>. GitHub is often used to host Jupyter notebooks for a publication, as we saw above. Note that GitHub hosts notebooks **statically**, meaning they cannot be executed. You can view them, and download them, but not run them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the structure of a notebook. Notebooks can contain text, images, and also code. When you execute Python code, the code is sent to a server (which can running on your local machine or elsewhere), and the results or output of the code appear in the notebook.\n",

    "A virtual environment is basically an isolated Python environment. \n",

    "Some projects will require many different packages, and some packages depend on certain versions of other packages. If, for example, a package requires version 1.5 of NumPy, but another project requires at most version 1.4, then you will have a dependency conflict and these can be difficult to solve. Therefore, it is much easier to manage smaller virtual environments for each project. \n",

    "# Numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "What is Numpy? You can think of it like an extension for Python which adds support for large matrix and array manipulation. It also provides a large amount of functions to work with these arrays, which we will see shortly. If you know MATLAB, then Numpy will seem very familiar to you. As opposed to Pandas, which deals with Excel style data, tabular data and so on, Numpy deals with numerical data only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy is by far the most used package in Python in the field of Machine Learning and Data Science. Knowing how it works is essential for any work in this domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we will dedicate an entire session to Numpy so that you are familiar with it, as it will be used a lot. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is also often used, and we will also cover Pandas later today.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arrays and Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "So what are arrays and matrices?\n",
    "\n",
    "An array is just a list of numbers. You might also know it has a vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = [1, 2, 3, 5, ..., n]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A Numpy array is at first glance very similar to a standard Python list, however it has far more functionality and built in features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy arrays, can be 1-dimensional, like a Python list, or they can be 2D, 3D, or even $n$-dimensional.\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard Numpy array is 1-dimensional, and is more or less equivalent to a standard Python list, at least at first glance. However they contain much more functionality than a standard Python list.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 2D Numpy array is like like a table (you can think of it as a list of 1D arrays), and is synonymous with a matrix in mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 3D array has a 3rd depth dimension. You can kind of think of it as a list of 2D arrays, and can be compared to a tensor in mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "![numpy](./img/numpy-matrices-crop.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Source*: <https://jovian.com/anujadp4/python-numerical-computing-with-numpy>\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy is n-dimensional, so you can define even further dimensions, for example a 4D array is a list of 3D arrays, and so on. In fact you can define up to 32 dimensions, however, in practical applications, it's rare to use arrays with more than 3 or 4 dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of data in your machine learning tasks are going to be either supplied to you as Numpy data, or you will manipulate this data using Numpy, or the software or algorithms will require input as Numpy data. Therefore, it is an essential skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only this, but Numpy is extremely fast an efficient compared to the built-in Python lists.\n",

    "If you think of Numpy as an array and matrix manipulation library, then Pandas, on the other hand, provides the functionality of R's Data Frames. Or you could think of it as Excel for Python. It allows you to manipulate data stored in Excel-like spreadsheets or R-like Data Frames, in a programmatic way. Pandas is best suited for **tabular** data that contains not only numerical data, but all data in the form of text or categorical data.\n",
