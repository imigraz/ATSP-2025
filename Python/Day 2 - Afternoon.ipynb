    "## StreamLit\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section will see how to use StreamLit, a web-application framework for Python. Web-applications are good ways to distrubute your working models. However, web-development is generally considered to be challenging, and therefore StreamLit is a way to develop web apps in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Streamlit allows you to build web applications using pure Python. It is similar to Shiny. \n",
    "\n",
    "Streamlit provides a number of controls, such as buttons, sliders, and so on so that you can interact with the application and the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "To start a Streamlit app you just run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "$ streamlit run script.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "from the command line. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write a very simple app now. We will place the following code in a file called `slider.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import streamlit as st\n",
    "\n",
    "# Write a title and some text to the app:\n",
    "st.title('Slider App')\n",
    "st.write('Demo of Streamlit Interaction')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a slider widget:\n",
    "value = st.slider('Please select a value:', 0, 100, 50)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Write the value back to the user:\n",
    "st.write(\"You selected the value of \", value, ' using the slider.')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the element `slider()` element to display the slider, with a minimum of 0, a maximum value of 100, and a default value of 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also notice, it is convention to import Streamlit as `st`, which gives you access to all the Streamlit controls.\n",
    "\n",
    ">See all the controls that Streamlit has available here: <https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference> and there is also a useful Cheat Sheet: <https://docs.streamlit.io/library/cheatsheet> \n",
    ">\n",
    ">On the left hand side, you will see all the types of elements, such as layout elements and data elements, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we can apply functions to the data, so we can modify this script to show your selected value squared, by adding the following function to the script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def squared(x):\n",
    "    return x**2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and then modify the `st.write()` statement to say the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "st.write(\"I'm \", squared(x), \"years old, squared.\")`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or something similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how when we made a change to the source code, the web application noticed this and asked if we'd like to reload the script. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Design principles\n",
    "\n",
    "But how does Streamlit update the `value` in the script above? How does it know when to update it? Normally in JavaScript you'd need to write all these event handlers to do this, for example by manually writing `onClick(e)` event handlers that are executed when events occur. This is quite complicated and requires a lot of coding and knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and how web applications work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Streamlit works in the following way: when you start an application, the `streamlit` application watches your web application, and any change to any element, such as a slider, re-runs your entire script again. You have to keep this in mind, that the entire script is re-run. \n",
    "\n",
    "This might sound time consuming and slow, especially if there is a calculation that is performed when a user moves a slider, but you can cache results so that a calculation only needs to be run once. If a function that is executed when an element is changed, you can use the `@st.cache_data` decorator to tell Streamlit to cache the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Displaying Data\n",
    "Streamlit is focussed on data science and machine learning applications. Therefore the displaying of data is one of its strengths. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following application:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "# Displaying Data\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "import streamlit as st\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame({\n",
    "  'first column': [1, 2, 3, 4],\n",
    "  'second column': [10, 20, 30, 40]\n",
    "})\n",
    "\n",
    "df\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's save this to a file called `table.py` and run it using `streamlit run table.py` from the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, you get a lot of interactivity for free. You can search rows, expand cells by double clicking on them, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are in doubt how to display an element, just try `st.write()` and most likely it will work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, plotting is supported, much like in `R`/`Shiny`. For example the following draws a simple plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import streamlit as st\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "chart_data = pd.DataFrame(\n",
    "     np.random.randn(20, 3),\n",
    "     columns=['a', 'b', 'c'])\n",
    "\n",
    "st.line_chart(chart_data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can save this to `plot.py` and see its output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, that if you wanted to draw a plot, you could generate the plot using MatPlotLib or Seaborn, and just use `st.write()` and it will most likely work. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for a MatPlotLib plot we could say the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "arr = np.random.normal(1, 1, size=100)\n",
    "fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n",
    "ax.hist(arr, bins=20)\n",
    "\n",
    "st.write(fig)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is actually a `pyplot()` function, so you would probably want to use `st.pyplot(fig)` instead of `st.write(fig)` but this demonstrates the fleixibility of the `st.write()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, those are the basics of how Streamlit applications work: you write a Python script, and Streamlit handles the updating of the elements by re-running the script each time the user makes a change to any button, slider, and so on. Of course, in our case, we wish to integrate a trained model with a web application, and we will do this now.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Integtration With a Trained Model\n",
    "\n",
    "For any models that you might train during your PhD, or you work at the medical university, you will want to be able to use Streamlit to actually deploy a machine learning based application. This can take several forms, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An application that allows an expert to label images, such as the example above. This application could also train a model as \n",
    "- An application that allows interaction with a trained model, for example one that allows a doctor to query the network for a classification based on an image he or she might upload\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first scenario you are using the application to train your model and to collect data. In the second scenario you are using a trained model that has you have already prepared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step one, let's create a new file, let's call it 'model.py' and add the following code to it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import torch\n",
    "from torchvision import models, transforms\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import streamlit as st\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set title of app\n",
    "st.title(\"Image Classifier\")\n",
    "st.write(\"Demo application for the ATSP course\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Enable users to upload images for the model to make predictions\n",
    "uploaded_file = st.file_uploader(\"Upload your image\", type = \"jpg\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we run this we see we have a nice file uplaoder, which let's use choose a file and upload it to the webpage. The `st.file_uploader()` function is doing all the hard work, including telling the browser that only JPEG images are allowed, that there is a 200MB limit, and also returns the uploaded image to the script in the form of `uploaded_file`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, as we can see we now need to import Torch and Torch Vision, as we are going to load a model previously trained using Torch. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to display this file back to the user, it is a simple case of using `st.image()` (note, you can add code to a running app, and Streamlit will notice a change and ask yo if you want to rerun the application):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if uploaded_file is not None:\n",
    "    # Display image that user uploaded\n",
    "    image = Image.open(uploaded_file)\n",
    "    st.image(image, caption = 'Uploaded Image', use_container_width = True)\n",
    "    st.write(\"\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice also that we included this `if` statement. What we are doing is checking if an image exists. If it exists, that is if the user uploaded the image, then display it. Otherwise display nothing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, every time a user interacts with an element, the entire script is re-run. Meaning after the user uploads a file, the script is re-run, this time with an image contained in `uploaded_file` and then the script above will execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have our image, we can load up a model and pass the image to the model. For that we will define a function that will be called when a user uploads an image. Let's just call it `predict()`: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def predict(image):\n",
    "    # Return top 5 predictions ranked by highest probability.\n",
    "    # First create a ResNet model\n",
    "    resnet = models.resnet18(pretrained = True)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Transform the input image through resizing, etc. We have seen this several times in the course already.\n",
    "    transform = transforms.Compose([\n",
    "        transforms.Resize(256),\n",
    "        transforms.CenterCrop(224),\n",
    "        transforms.ToTensor(),\n",
    "        transforms.Normalize(\n",
    "            mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406],\n",
    "            std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]\n",
    "        )])\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Load the image, apply preprocessing, and make predictions\n",
    "    img = Image.open(image)\n",
    "    single_image_batch = torch.unsqueeze(transform(img), 0)\n",
    "    resnet.eval()\n",
    "    out = resnet(single_image_batch)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Read the classes file, which contains the 1000 classes of ImageNet\n",
    "    with open('imagenet_classes.txt') as f:\n",
    "        classes = [line.strip() for line in f.readlines()]\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Return the top 5 predictions, ranked by probability\n",
    "    prob = torch.nn.functional.softmax(out, dim = 1)[0]\n",
    "    _, indices = torch.sort(out, descending = True)\n",
    "\n",
    "    return [(classes[i], prob[i].item()) for i in indices[0][:5]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can place this anywhere in the code, as it will be executed by Streamlit when the app is loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to display these predictions, which we will do under the image, where we said `if uploaded_file is not None:` previously:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if uploaded_file is not None:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Display image that user uploaded\n",
    "    image = Image.open(uploaded_file)\n",
    "    st.image(image, caption = 'Uploaded Image', use_container_width= True)\n",
    "    st.write(\"\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Make the prediction\n",
    "    labels = predict(uploaded_file)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Format the labels a bit better\n",
    "    formatted = []\n",
    "    for i, v in enumerate(labels):\n",
    "        formatted.append([i+1, v[0].split(',')[1], v[0].split(',')[0], v[1]])\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Save to a Pandas DataFrame\n",
    "    df = pd.DataFrame(formatted, columns=['Rank', 'Prediction', 'Class Index', 'Probability'])\n",

    "    \n",
    "    # Show the DataFrame\n",
    "    st.dataframe(df)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can see the results in a Pandas DataFrame. If we wanted to make the table match the size of the parent element, we could use `st.dataframe(df, use_container_width=True)`. \n",
